# Create Story Workflow

**Goal:** Create a comprehensive story file that gives the dev agent everything needed for flawless implementation.

**Your Role:** Story context engine that prevents LLM developer mistakes, omissions, or disasters.
- Communicate all responses in {communication_language} and generate all documents in {document_output_language}
- Your purpose is NOT to copy from epics - it's to create a comprehensive, optimized story file that gives the DEV agent EVERYTHING needed for flawless implementation
- COMMON LLM MISTAKES TO PREVENT: reinventing wheels, wrong libraries, wrong file locations, breaking regressions, ignoring UX, vague implementations, lying about completion, not learning from past work
- EXHAUSTIVE ANALYSIS REQUIRED: You must thoroughly analyze ALL artifacts to extract critical context - do NOT be lazy or skim! This is the most important function in the entire development process!
- UTILIZE SUBPROCESSES AND SUBAGENTS: Use research subagents, subprocesses or parallel processing if available to thoroughly analyze different artifacts simultaneously and thoroughly
- SAVE QUESTIONS: If you think of questions or clarifications during analysis, save them for the end after the complete story is written
- ZERO USER INTERVENTION: Process should be fully automated except for initial epic/story selection or missing documents

---

## INITIALIZATION

### Configuration Loading

Load config from `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/config.yaml` and resolve:

- `project_name`, `user_name`
- `communication_language`, `document_output_language`
- `user_skill_level`
- `planning_artifacts`, `implementation_artifacts`
- `date` as system-generated current datetime

### Paths

- `sprint_status` = `{implementation_artifacts}/sprint-status.yaml`
- `epics_file` = `{planning_artifacts}/epics.md`
- `prd_file` = `{planning_artifacts}/prd.md`
- `architecture_file` = `{planning_artifacts}/architecture.md`
- `ux_file` = `{planning_artifacts}/*ux*.md`
- `story_title` = "" (will be elicited if not derivable)
- `project_context` = `**/project-context.md` (load if exists)
- `default_output_file` = `{implementation_artifacts}/{{story_key}}.md`
- `manual_qa_override` = `false` (set to `true` only if the user's invocation prompt contains `--skip-manual-qa-gate <reason>`; the reason is captured verbatim and recorded in the new story's Change Log)

### Input Files

| Input | Description | Path Pattern(s) | Load Strategy |
|-------|-------------|------------------|---------------|
| prd | PRD (fallback - epics file should have most content) | whole: `{planning_artifacts}/*prd*.md`, sharded: `{planning_artifacts}/*prd*/*.md` | SELECTIVE_LOAD |
| architecture | Architecture (fallback - epics file should have relevant sections) | whole: `{planning_artifacts}/*architecture*.md`, sharded: `{planning_artifacts}/*architecture*/*.md` | SELECTIVE_LOAD |
| ux | UX design (fallback - epics file should have relevant sections) | whole: `{planning_artifacts}/*ux*.md`, sharded: `{planning_artifacts}/*ux*/*.md` | SELECTIVE_LOAD |
| epics | Enhanced epics+stories file with BDD and source hints | whole: `{planning_artifacts}/*epic*.md`, sharded: `{planning_artifacts}/*epic*/*.md` | SELECTIVE_LOAD |

## EXECUTION

<workflow>

<step n="0" goal="Manual QA gate — block creation if any prior story awaits Project Lead sign-off">
  <critical>🛑 MANUAL QA GATE — enforces the handoff contract from epic-2 retro action #3 (2026-04-10).
    No new story is created if any story in sprint-status.yaml is in `awaiting-manual-qa`,
    unless the user explicitly overrides via `--skip-manual-qa-gate <reason>` in their prompt.
    This step runs BEFORE any other discovery or analysis.</critical>

  <!-- Parse override flag from the user's invocation prompt -->
  <action>Scan the user's invocation prompt for the exact token `--skip-manual-qa-gate`</action>
  <check if="token `--skip-manual-qa-gate` is present in the user prompt">
    <action>Extract the reason that immediately follows the token (quoted or unquoted; required, non-empty)</action>
    <check if="no reason was provided after the flag, or reason is empty/whitespace">
      <output>🚫 `--skip-manual-qa-gate` requires a non-empty reason.

        Example:
        `create the next story --skip-manual-qa-gate "hotfix, Marius validated 2-2 verbally on Slack 2026-04-10"`
      </output>

      This override will be recorded in the new story's Change Log for audit.</output>

  <action>Collect the list of ALL story keys whose status value equals `awaiting-manual-qa`.

  <check if="at least one story is in `awaiting-manual-qa`">
    <output>🛑 **BLOCKED — Manual QA gate**

      Cannot create a new story while the following stories are awaiting Project Lead sign-off:

      {{list of awaiting-manual-qa story keys, one per line, prefixed with `• `}}

      **What to do:**
      1. Open each story file above and walk its `## Manual QA Checklist` section
      2. Bring up the stack with `docker compose up --build` and execute each checklist step
      3. Sign off the checklist: tick all boxes, add date + initials at the bottom
      4. Transition the story Status to `done` in BOTH the story file AND {{sprint_status}}
      5. Re-run `create-story`

      **Override (use sparingly — audit-logged in the new story's Change Log):**
      Re-invoke with `--skip-manual-qa-gate "<your reason>"` appended to the prompt.
      Example:
      `create the next story --skip-manual-qa-gate "validated verbally on Slack 2026-04-10"`

      **Why this block exists:** epic-2 retro (2026-04-10) identified that the workflow
      silently skipped manual QA on two consecutive epics. This gate is the load-bearing
      fix. Do not disable it without recording why.
